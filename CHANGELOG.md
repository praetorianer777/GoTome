## [Unreleased]

### Added

- GOtome runs as two containers, the app and its database, started with one
  `docker compose` file. Images are published for amd64 and arm64.
- First-run setup creates the administrator account in the browser.
- Sign in with user name and password. Sessions last 30 days without use, and
  repeated wrong passwords are slowed down.
- Three roles: Administrator, Editor and Reader.
- A web app with light and dark colours that also works on a phone. The library
  view is still empty: importing books comes next.
- Libraries. An administrator adds a library that GOtome manages itself, or
  points GOtome at an existing folder, which it only reads unless allowed to
  change files. A library is shared with everybody or private to its owner and
  members. Removing a library from GOtome never deletes its folder or files.
